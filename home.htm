              <div>Dear Friends,</div>
          <div>Another year has past and once again it has gone by way too fast! It’s been another year of ups and downs, but through it all there has always been one constant, and that is our wonderful Lord! The children have grown so much and I no longer have a “little baby”. Even though Avery will always be my baby, I’m definitely not allowed to call him that anymore. If I do he always corrects me with “I not a baby, I Avery!” We are still homeschooling and I must admit, it has definitely been a good thing this year with all of Jon’s traveling. We’ve been able to pack up all our books and go with him to Pensacola, FL. He’s been doing work down here pretty much since August. His first trip down,we spent 5 out of the 8 weeks he was gone apart and learned very quickly that being together, no matter where it was, was much better. It’s been hard being away from all our family, but we’re just so thankful to have had the opportunity to go with him! We can’t wait to be home for Christmas! Molly is 9, and is such a wonderful help to me. She loves babies and especially loves to take care of her little cousin Lincoln. Emily is 8 and a sweetheart. She enjoys organizing play time with Evan, Avery and cousin Owen. She has a very big imagination and loves to pretend! Evan is a little more timid with things and tends to be a little more wary of people and new places, but give him a chance to warm up and he’s great! Avery on the other hand, has not an ounce of fear in his body. But thankfully the Lord made him with a really hard head ( and I don’t mean stubborn, though he is that as well, but literally, a hard head) I stand in awe as I watch him jump from something or fall from something and I wait for the cry that never comes! He just jumps up and keeps on going! All the children are such a blessing and I’m so thankful for each of them, (as well as their amazing and wonderful father!!!)<br>
                <br>
              It’s crazy how one little six letter word can so change your lives, but as most of you know, CANCER reared it’s ugly head once more this year, this time attacking my mom.<br>
              <br>
              Just like with Ethan though, it shocks you, sends you reeling not knowing which way is up and then suddenly God’s wonderful peace quiets and calms, and then you focus on the battle aspect, and do what we have to do to beat this thing. My mom was chosen for a study and has done incredibly well with it. She has had some really hard days though. It’s so hard to watch and know that you really can’t do anything to make things better. But even on her “bad days”, if you were to talk to her on the phone, you would have no clue that there was anything wrong with her. She has amazing strength and grace and beauty through all that she is going through, and for all of that we give the glory and honor to the Lord! We will definitely be celebrating this Christmas! Mother had her last chemo treatment on December 10th, and though she still has a ways to go with surgery and radiation, it is so wonderful to not have any more of that horrible chemo!<br>
              <br>
              Ethan is never far from our thoughts. In our memories he will always be our sweet baby boy and as I remember holding him and seeing his precious little smile, I think of Mary. Did she truly understand that the baby boy that she held in her arms that night so long ago was going to be the Saviour of all mankind?  What a precious gift! I am so thankful for all that has been given to us. The Lord is forever faithful. We wish you all a very Merry Christmas and a wonderful New Year!<br>

              <div>Dear Friends,<br>
                Well we were trying to get this letter out last week and had
                we actually gotten it done, we would have told you how wonderful
                it was that spring was here!! It was so warm and we were so enjoying
                spending time outside and looking forward to Easter. However, since
                the the middle of last week it went from the high 80's to the low
                50's and getting down to freezing at night. We're not complaining
                though, because we know that it will be hot again before we know
                it and then we'll be begging for the cool! <br>
                  <br>
                We have been doing really
                well lately. We're thankful the the kids are all finally well.
                We had a rough winter with lots of sickness running through the
                family.<br>
                  <br>
                Avery's the only one left with a lingering ear infection.
                But were hoping and praying that this final round of antibiotics
                will take care of it. If not, then he'll probably need to have
                tubes.<br>
                  <br>
                Jon had knee surgery back in February for a torn miniscus
                (not sure of spelling on that) but anyhow he's doing much better
                and almost back to normal. We are looking forward the the Nigh
                family beach trip in May.<br>
                  <br>
                Evan will just come in out of the blue
                and say that he wants to go to the beach, and of course when we
                tell him that we're going in May he says 'OK', but it really means
                nothing to him!! He's been sweet in little things he says about
                Ethan lately. You can tell that his little mind is just trying
                to figure everything out. Jon took him to see Ethan (graveside)
                a few weeks ago and as they were driving away he said " I want
                Ethan here". i just
                wonder so often what it would be like to have 2 little guys the
                same age. Evan has kind of come out of his shell the past few months
                and has been getting in a bit more trouble. I just wonder if the
                boys would both be going through the  "ornery" stage or if they
                would kind of occupy each other a little more!<br>
                  <br>
                I'm posting a "new" yet
                old picture of Ethan and Evan back when they were about 8 months
                old. It brings back such sweet memories of that day. The girls
                were with my mom so it was just me and the boys, and Ethan was
                having a good day strength wise. He couldn't usually sit up in
                the booster seats because he was just so weak, but that day, I
                tried putting him in it and he did great! I was doing stuff in
                the kitchen that day and they had such a good time playing together.
                It seemed so normal that day with giggles and&nbsp;laughs from
                my little boys. It was really only the one time that I can remember
                the boys being together after Ethan got sick. It sounds bad, but
                I just couldn't risk Evan pulling out Ethan's broviak (tube in
                his chest). Evan always thought that the little curly tube coming
                out of his brother looked like something fun to play with!!! Anyway,
                we're so thankful for the wonderful memories that Lord has allowed
                us to have and will continue to make in the future! <br>
                  <br>
                The children are growing up so fast, but we are enjoying each
                day we have! Molly is growing into such a sweet young lady, and
                Emily's not far behind. Evan is still a sweetheart even though
                he's a bit more fiesty. And Avery is my precious gift from God
                and we treaure his cuddly love!<br>
                  <br>
                May each of you take a moment and remember how wonderful God's
                love is for us. He supplies our every need and many times even
                before we ask! He is good and faithful!</div>

            Dear Friends,<br>
We hope you all are having a wonderful holiday season! We feel bad that we haven't
put any updates on here since July, but things just get busy as you all know!! <br>
            <br>
Well, the past months have been really good. We were able to go to Florida for
a weeks vacation in the beginning of September. We had so much fun and the children
really had a wonderful time. One of the highlights of the trip was that we were
able to see the space shuttle launch! It was only 1 1/2 hrs. away from where
we were staying, and after 2 scrubbed missions (and 1 wasted trip) we were finally
able to see it! We also had fun at the Alligator Farm. We can't believe that
Evan actually sat on that alligator(see new pictures). Even though it was not
real, it was still a bit intimidating!!!<br>
            <br>
Other than that, it's just pretty much been school and work and just the normal
stuff. Molly's 71/2 now and such a big help to me. She's still my &quot;little
mother&quot; of the family and loves to help take care of Avery!<br>
            <br>
Emily is 6 and has really become interested in art. She seems to be coloring
or drawing or making something anytime she gets a free moment!<br>
            <br>
Evan is 2, and is finally making some sense with his words! I love being able
to carry on a conversation with a 2 year old!! Last month, he was sitting on
the cupboard while I was making dinner, and we were talking about the little
pictures of all the children that are in the windowsill. He was naming everyone
and when I pointed to Ethan and asked who that was, for the first time he said &quot;Ethan&quot; (in
his own little cute way). Usually it's just baby or he gets him confused with
Avery. I was so excited, because I talk to him about Ethan alot, even though
I don't expect him to understand. Anyhow, after he said who it was, I asked him
where Ethan was? He looked at me, held up his chubby little finger up to the
sky and and clear as day said, &quot;up with Jesus&quot;. Oh my goodness, talk
about melting my heart! It was just the sweetest little thing!<br>
            <br>
Then there's Avery. What a little blessing he is and a true joy! He is a very
easy going, laid back little guy who just goes with the flow and loves life!
His smile and those big blue eyes just make my day every day! He's 6 months old
now and weighs 18 1/2 pounds, which is actually 4 pounds more than Ethan and
Evan were at 6 mo. So he definately enjoys to eat and his favorite activity is
jumping in his little Johnny jump-up seat! That kid can really get some air!<br>
<br>
Jon made his 9th trip to Panama back in October and had a really great time there!
It's been so awesome to see how the Lord is working among the people there. <br>
<br>
Well, as we enter this holiday season and things seem to be so busy and hectic,
remember to take the time to focus on the true meaning of Christmas. God gave
us His Son, the most perfect and wonderful gift ever given. I hope that each
one of you have a very blessed Christmas! Enjoy your familes and loved ones and
always be thankful for the many blessings the Lord has given!<br>

            Where in the world does the time go? Evan just had his 2 year birthday
              on Wednesday and it just amazes me! The past 2 years have flown
              by so quickly! We had a great day though and I thought I'd share
              a few pictures with you! We had a small party with Jeremy, Summer
              and Owen ( we're having a big family party this weekend, but wanted
              to celebrate the actual day!!)<br>
              <br>
After the cake and icecream we all drove over to the cemetary and let balloons
go in memory of Ethan. We had a ceramic picture of Ethan made that we put on
the headstone a few weeks ago. So when we go to visit now, it's nice to see his
smiling face. As you can see from the pictures Evan and Owen really like it as
well!! It was a very happy day and we are so thankful to have our little Evan!
The Lord is faithful!

            Jon and I are so happy to announce the arrival of our little boy,
              Avery Hudson Smith! He was born on June 5th, 2006 and weighed 7lbs
              14oz and was 20in long. He's a beautiful little blue eyed ( at
              least for now) baby with a head full of dark hair! He has been
              a true joy and we are enjoying every minute with him! The girls
              are of course thrilled with him and Evan seems to really love him
              as well! <br>
              <br>
            The Lord has been so faithful through the past year as we went through
            all of &quot;the firsts&quot; concerning little Ethan. It was crazy
            though because you never knew how a holiday or an event would affect
            you. There were times that I thought would be really hard to handle
            and I would breeze right through them only to be caught off guard
            by a random memory that would open up the floodgates of tears. It
            was amazing how when the 1 year anniversary of Ethan's diagnosis
            came around in February, how we could replay so much in our minds
            of the daily events leading up to his death. It was a time of sadness
            and yet joy. To be able to remember all of the wonderful times that
            we were able to share with him, and just how blessed we were to have
            have known him for the 9 months that we did! <br>
            <br>
            There are so many people
            who lose their little ones before birth, before ever catching a glimpse
            of what their child may have become. But the Lord gave us that glimpse
            of the goodness and sweetness of Ethan, and for that we are, and
            forever will be thankful. And now, as I look into the eyes of little
            Avery, we again feel the love and goodness of our Lord. Had it been
            left up to us, we may not have had anymore children. We always talked
            about wanting 4 children and we had 2 girls and 2 boys and everything
            just seemed right. But His ways are not our ways, and after the loss
            of Ethan, we just really felt that we would like to have another
            child close to Evan. Once again, the Lord has blessed us with another
            beautiful baby boy. We can only wonder what the Lord has in store
            for him! <br>            <br>
            It's still hard to watch Evan and not think of Ethan. When I watch
            him run around being his cute little self, I can just picture his
            little blue eyed counterpart running along beside him being just
            as goofy!! But I just can't say it enough, how faithful the Lord
            is. He gives the same measure of grace that we need day after day,
            just when we need it even still. He's always there no matter what
            and He makes no mistakes even though we don't understand why things
            happen.<br>
            Jon and I want to again thank you for all of your thoughts and prayers
            through the past year and a half. ( and especially for the safe arrival
            of Avery!) He's wonderful and we thank you for sharing in this joyous
            occasion with us!<br>
            <br> 
            We would like to share the following poem with
            you:
            <p align="center"> That day will never break;<br>
  I'll pin my faith, my all in Him, <br>
  He maketh no mistake.</p>
            <p align="center"> There's so much now I cannot see,<br>
  My eyesight is far too dim;<br>
  But come what may, I'll simply trust,<br>
  And leave it all to Him.</p>
            <p align="center"> For by and by the mist will lift<br>
  And plain it all He'll make;<br>
  Through all the way, tho dark to me,<br>
  He made not one mistake.<br>

            First of all we would like to wish all of you a Merry Christmas!
            I know these days can be very busy, but it's such a wonderful and
            fun time as well!<br>
            <br>
It has been an amazing year as most everyone knows! I still sit here and can't
believe how quickly our lives can change in such a short time. Last year at this
time, we had no idea of what was to come the following year. But the Lord continues
to comfort and strengthen us each day. We miss Ethan so much, but we find such
comfort in remembering him and what a sweet little boy he was! We feel so fortunate
to have known him even for such a short time. You can tell the character of a
person pretty quickly and Ethan definately had a lot of character. He brought
a smile to the faces of everyone who knew him as well as joy to their hearts.
We continue to pray that hearts will be touched through the life of our little
Ethan!<br>
            <br>
Well, we do have some exciting news! We feel blessed to announce the arrival
of yet another Smith in June 2006! We were told by the Doctor last week after
an ultrasound that he's 65% sure that it's going to be a little boy! I'll be
sure to keep you informed if anything changes!!! The girls are so excited and
Evan will be happy to have a brother once he realizes what a brother is (and
also when he knows that his little brother won't dress in him doll clothes).
I'm just hoping that Evan will be walking by the time the new baby arrives! He's
very close! He will take a few steps sometimes and he's got great balance when
he tries, but so far hasn't really had the desire to get serious about it!<br>
            <br>
Molly's big news recently is that she's lost her 2 bottom front teeth! Her first
tooth took forever to come out. It was all new to her and she was afraid to pull
at it too much. But once she actually pulled it out she found out it wasn't too
bad. Her next tooth came out in about 10 minutes. She just came down one morning
and said, "I'm going to pull my tooth!" And that's exactly what she did! She's
doing really well in homeschool and she and Emily both really enjoy "Classical
Conversations". It's a group of about 30 families and we meet at a church on
Mondays from 9-12. They have really learned alot. They study History, Latin,
Math, Science, Geography as well as other things. It's been a great experience!
Emily had her hair cut back in September and donated 10 inches of her hair to
Locks of Love. They make wigs for children with cancer. She was really excited
about doing it and I must admit, I love her with short hair!<br>
            <br>
Jon has had a good but busy year with work and his new position in the office.
He also was able to make another trip to Panama in October with Dave Scoble.
They were building a house for families to stay when they come in from the jungle
to attend conferences in Piriati. They were able to just about finish everything,
except for some of the work inside the house. He had a wonderful time though!<br>
            <br>
            I do hope each and every one of you have a blessed and Merry Christmas!
            Jesus truly is the reason for this season as well as every other
            season. May we strive each day to do all things for His honor and
            glory!
Merry Christmas! <br>

            Thank you all so much for making the boys birthday so special!
                Evan had a wonderful time and it was a sweet time to remember
                our little Ethan! We had a great turnout for the party and were
                able to give alot of wonderful toys to the hospital! We took
                them over on Tuesday, and it was so good to see everyone again,
                this time in happier circumstances!<br>            <br>
            The past few months since Ethan has been gone have been full
                of ups and downs, but through all of our crazy emotions, the
                Lord has been constant! I honestly
  don't know how people can do it without the Lord! On the days when we long
  to have our little boy here with us, to be able to just give it to the Lord
  and say with total trust, &quot; this was Your will and he is in Your Hands,
  helps to put our minds at ease and rest in His love &amp; care.<br>  <br>
  We continue to covet your prayers in the following days! The children are all
  doing really well! We are going to be starting homeschool with the girls at
  the end of Aug. Molly, who is 6, will be in first grade and Emily, who will
  be 5 in Sept. will start kindergarten. Evan continues to be a blessing to our
  hearts. He's such a sweet and loving little boy and absolutely loves his big
  sisters, even though they at times seem to drive him crazy!! <br>  <br>
  Thank you again for making the evening so special and for your continued thoughts
  and prayers!
  <div align="right">In His Love,<br>
  Jon &amp; Caroline Smith</div></p>
              <p>P.S. We wanted you to see the headstone that we were able to
                get for Ethan! When I was little, we would pass a cemetary
                that had a headstone with a little lamb on top. I always wanted
                my mother to drive by slowly so I could see it. I don't know
                why I was so mesmorized by that stone as a child, but I knew
                right away that I wanted a stone just like that for Ethan. We
                just love it, and though we know that he's not there in the ground,
                it's been a comfort for us to be able to go there and to have
                that little lamb to remind us of our &quot;little lamb&quot;.

		    <strong>Evan's Life...Ethan's Legacy: a celebration of hope</strong><br>
Evan Smith (Ethan's twin brother) is turning 1 year old and we want to share
this blessed occasion with you. We are so thankful for the many thousands of
people who have helped our family during Ethan's bout with cancer and the days
following his homegoing. His life, though seemingly short was not in vain. <br>
                <br>
Please come to Evan's drop-in birthday party, but don't bring toys for him. Rather,
we ask that you <strong>please bring a toy from the list below for the cancer
patients in Greenville Memorial Hospital's Pediatric Oncology ward.</strong><br>
                <br>
We've seen firsthand the ways that the our doctors and other hospital staff are
doing their best to combat cancer, and we want to give back some of the light
that the doctors, nurses and others involved with the Hospital System have shone
on us.<br>
            <br>
Please look over the information below and see how you can help. Be sure to download
the <a href="images/bday_info.pdf">Information flyer</a> and put it on your fridge.
We look forward to seeing you there.

		  Our little Ethan is now in the presence of the Lord. To be honest
            with you, if anyone had told us that we would have never brought
            him home after this last visit to Charleston, we would have said
            they were crazy!! But it is truly amazing to see how the Lord had
            His hand in the whole situation. <br>            <br>
            Ethan had the surgery on Thursday and that is when the doctors discovered
            just how big the tumor was and how much damage it had already caused.
            They said the tumor was about half of Ethans body weight which would
            make it about 7 lbs. The left lobe of the liver they found out had
            scar tissue and could not be saved. So it came down to this, we could
            try other types of experimental chemo to shrink the tumor and still
            try to remove it, but he would still have to have a liver transplant
            after that.<br>
            <br>
            The problem we would run into at that point is, if they
            didn't get all the cancer cells, as soon as he started the anti-rejection
            drugs from the transplant, they would tell his body that every thing
            was fine, and then the cancer would spread like wild fire. Within
            only a couple of months we would be right back to where we started,
            only poor little Ethan would have endured so much. We made the decision
            to not go any farther with treatments. We were going to get Ethan
            home just as soon as we could and just love him and take care of
            him until the Lord took him home. Once again though, the Lord helped
            us through a very difficult situation.<br>
            <br>
            The thought of bringing him
            home and not knowing how long he would have to suffer before he died
            was the hardest thing for both Jon and I. We knew that He would give
            us that measure of grace when the time came, but instead, He didn't
            make us go through it at all.<br>            <br>
            On Friday night, our Dr. from the PICU took us aside and told us
            that there was a good chance that Ethan would not come off the ventilator.
            They had been trying to wean him off all day, but with no success.
            He said that they wanted to try to take him off between 8-10:00 the
            next morning. We called all of our family to prepare them for the
            possibilty of his death, and then prayed for God's Will to be done.
            We had such wonderful doctors and nurses while we were there. They
            were so thoughtful and compassionate towards us and we will be forever
            grateful to them for all they did.<br>
            <br>
            At about 9:30 on Sat. morning
            they took the tube out. We had made the decision to not put it back
            if he was having trouble. The doctors said that they could keep him
            on it 4-5 days, but didn't feel that the outcome would be any different.
            After they took him off the ventilator, they took out all his IV's
            and closed the curtain around us, brought in a rocking chair and
            put Ethan in my arms. He struggled for a few minutes, but then calmed
            right down. Jon and I held him and rocked him and sang to him. He
            was so peaceful and sweet! His breathing began to slow down and as
            I rested my hand over his heart, it began to beat slower and slower
            until it just stopped. We held him for an hour and a half. It seemed
            like only minutes. If anyone would have told me that I could hold
            my little baby as he died, I would have said there's no way. It would
            be too hard. But I feel that I need to share the final minutes that
            we had with him because it was so sweet and so peaceful. Jon said
            it so sweetly, &quot;how wonderful it was to see Ethan go from his
            mothers arms into our Heavenly Fathers arms.&quot; The Lord was so
            merciful to us to take Ethan so quickly.<br>            <br>
Jon and I have an amazing peace even still. We miss Ethan of course, but I think
what has made it so much easier is the fact that we never prayed for God to heal
him. We could only pray that the Lord's perfect will would be done. Jon and I
had to pray without certain expectations, because if we said that we just knew
that Ethan would be OK, it would just open us up to be bitter towards God for
not answering our prayers.<br>
<br>
But he did answer our prayers. His will was done.
Ethan's purpose in life was fulfilled, it just happened to be in 8 1/2 short
months. Jon and I are so thankful for the time that we had with Ethan. He was
such a blessing and we love him so much. We are now ready to go on though. We
have 3 beautiful children who need our love and attention. The girls have handled
things very well. It's hard, but God is also giving them the grace they need
whether they know it or not. Thank you all for you thoughts and prayers, emails
and letters, meals and gifts.<br>
<br>
The Lord has used each and every one of you in
our lives, I wish we could thank each one of you personally for everything. I
especially want to thank our doctors and nurses who God placed in our lives.
You are all so special! When you spend as much time in doctors offices and hopsitals
as we have, you really rely on the care and support offered by each one involved.
There was no one involved with little Ethan's care that God did not place there,
and for that we are so grateful!<br><br>
The Lord has used this in our lives to draw us close to Him as well as to each
other. I am so thankful to Jon for his love and support. He's such a wonderful
daddy and husband. The Lord has showed His love and mercy over and over. Whenever
there was a decision to be made that was too hard, He just closed that door and
led us another direction. It's just amazing to see now, after being on the other
side of this whole ordeal, how God's hand led us all the way.<br>

       	    We received some disheartening news this evening. During the course
              of the surgery today the doctors learned that the
              left side of Ethan's liver has been compromised by the cancer and
              that re-sectioning it is no longer an option. Also, due to the
              size of the tumor they are unable to remove any portion of it with
              surgery. <br>
              <br>
Sadly, this also means that Ethan won't be able to receive any donor liver of
any kind.<br>
              <br>
Currently Jon and Caroline are discussing other possible methods of treatment
with some of the nation's top doctors. Please pray that the Grace of God will
continue to sustain them through this most difficult part of Ethan's Voyage.<a href="#top"> &raquo;top

       	    Jon
       	      and Caroline recently sent word from Charleston that Ethan will
       	      be going into surgery tomorrow morning (4-21-05).<br>
       	      <br>
   	        The purpose of
       	    the surgery is to attempt a re-sectioning of his liver (not a simple
       	    procedure), but the doctors are still
           	     uncertain about whether or not they will even have this option.
           	     Once they start the surgery and are able to assess the situation
           	     they will reach a definitive conclusion.<br>
           	     <br>
   	        If they are unable to
   	        remove the cancerous right lobe and save the left lobe, they will
   	        instead opt for removing all they can
           	     of the tumor.<br>
           	     <br>
   	        The family asks that you please make a special
   	        effort to remember Ethan in prayer on Wednesday as he undergoes this
   	        complicated
           	     surgical procedure. We sincerely thank you all for your prayers

          We must start this update with saying how grateful we are to have such
            a gracious and merciful God. He takes care of our every need. We
            are so unworthy, yet He looks upon us with such love and in every
            way lets us know that He is right there beside us. He's working out
            details that to us seem impossible!<br>            <br>
We got the call this afternoon about 4:15 from our Transplant coordinator. It
was confirmed by the doctors today that I couldn't donate my liver. However,
we were presented with a possible option by them for Ethan! This is a very slight
chance, but they felt today, after looking over the films of the liver and tumor
that they may be able to save his liver. <br>
<br>
The left lobe of his liver looks like
it's in great shape and they may be able to remove the tumor and the right lobe
of the liver and leave the left lobe. It would then be able to regenerate on
it's own and a transplant wouldn't even be needed!! We have to be in Charleston
by noon on Tues. and they will be doing laproscopic surgery to see if this really
can be done! <br><br>
It's really hard to describe our feelings right now! Just the thought of not
going through ALL that is involved with a liver transplant and the lifetime of
anti-rejection
drugs is amazing to us!!<br><br>
We would truly covet your prayers concerning this matter! And once again, no
matter what the outcome, our little baby is in His hands! Thank you all for your
thoughts and encouragement! <a href="#top">&raquo;top of page<br>

          I was called back from MUSC a little while ago. The doctors met yesterday
            and have decided that we can't do a Live Donor Transplant. The vein
            that is in the middle of the liver they feel is either being compressed
            by the tumor or the tumor is around it. There is another group of
            doctors meeting tomorrow at 3:00. They handle more tumors and will
            be able to give us a definite answer on this.<br>            <br>
Ethan was not able to have a bone scan done yesterday because they were concerned
about sedating him for so long with just the normal sedation drug (the test takes
about 1 1/2 to 2 hrs) We couldn't get anything scheduled again until Monday,
here in Greenville. He will have to be put under by an anesthesiologist. After
it is confirmed that the cancer has not spread to his bones then he can be put
on the donor list right away.<br>
<br> 
His chest CT scan came out clear for which we are
thankful, and it showed that the tumor has not grown at all since the last scan.
His bones are probably fine, since it hasn't spread to his lungs, but they just
have to be sure! <br><br>
We will probably leave on Mon. evening to go to Charleston where Ethan will be
put into the ICU while we wait for a donor. We will wait about 2 weeks and if
nothing becomes available, then we will start another round of chemo. We will
then have to wait until he's on the upside of that until we can try for another
liver.<br><br>
The Lord is still giving such a peace! He's taking a lot of the guesswork out
of it for us by removing options. So for that, we really are so thankful! It
just helps us to see and remember that Ethan is truly in His hands. Nothing will
touch him that God has not already planned. The Lord sees the other side of this
and whatever the outcome, we can rest in the peace of knowing that His will is
being done! <br><br>
Thank you for all of your kind letters and e-mails! They are so encouraging!
We will keep you all informed!<br>

          WOW is about all I can say of the past 3 days!! Thank you so much
             for all your prayers! They were much needed and felt! <br>
             <br>
On Monday, our morning started at 6:30 and ended that evening at 6:30 with no
breakfast,lunch or even snack breaks!! We met with doctors, surgeons, nurses
and social workers. Ethan had 2 ultrasounds, a chest X-ray, lab work and an EKG.
They fit 4 days of tests into the one day.<br>
<br>
We are really thankful though because I know alot of strings were pulled to accomplish
what we did! On Tuesday I had to meet with my doctor, and social worker and have
an ultrasound.<br>
<br>
I still have to have a few more tests to determine if they can use my liver (Jon
really wanted
to be the donor, but the Dr. took one look at him and said &quot;nope, too big!!&quot;)
They, for obvious reasons have to use the smaller liver!<br>
<br>
While I was busy on Tues. Jon stayed with Ethan while he had a blood transfusion.
His blood count had gone down to 7 and they don't like to see it go below 8.
They were so nice
there and had no problem getting him taken care of.<br>
<br>
We then had to leave straight from there on Tues. to be home early Wed. morning
for Ethan to have a chest/abdomen CT scan and a bone scan at Greenville Memorial.
They weren't able to schedule those tests in Charleston. We were also able to
meet with our Dr. and have a
few more questions answered.<br>
<br>
As of Wed. night I still have not heard how the committee meeting went today
in Charleston, but I'm going to try to simply let you know what our options are
and the decisions that will have to be made in the next 2 weeks.
<p><span class="newshead">1.</span> Determination of the main artery that goes
  through the middle of Ethan's liver. If the tumor is around it all then a Live
  Donor transplant cannot even be done, because he will need a whole liver with
  that vein in it.</p>
<p><span class="newshead">2.</span> Testing on my liver to be sure it can be
  used. The donor liver must be perfect. If mine can't be used, Live donor is
  also out of the question.</p>
<p><span class="newshead">3.</span> After talking with our Dr. today, we feel
  that we have 2 weeks to wait for a regular transplant (not involving me) Ethan
  will be put on the donor list ASAP, but if no donors come in and my liver is
  able to be used, we will go ahead and do the Live Donor transplant at that
  time.</p>
<p><span class="newshead">4.</span> If we get to 2 weeks and I can't donate my
  liver and there has not been a donor, then we really have no choice but to
  do another round of chemo to keep the tumor from spreading and growing. However,
  if this is done and a liver becomes available during the chemo, he won't be
  able to have the transplant. He has to wait until he's on the upside of the
  chemo before anything can be done.</p>
<p><span class="newshead">5.</span> There is also the possibility of the Dr's
  saying a transplant can't even be done. If that is the case, then Ethan will
  go ahead and finish the 4 rounds of chemo, and then they will try experimental
  drugs that are much stronger and therefore it would be a much higher complication
  risk for him. We were assured by our Dr. today that a transplant right now
  is a much better plan than the experimental drugs. They will only be our last
  resort.</p>
I will try to post new news as soon as we know something! Again thank you
  so much for your prayers! We love you all! <a href="#top">&raquo;top of page<br><br>

          On Good Friday, Jon and I sat in the Doctors office and listened as
             the Dr. confirmed what we already felt. The tumor was not shrinking
             from the chemo this time at all.<br>
             <br>
I asked him if the tumor could just be removed and was told that it couldn't
because of all the blood vessels involved with the liver. We left feeling like
we had reached the end of the road. Jon and I never really admitted it to each
other at the time, nor did we tell anyone else that we felt that Ethan didn't
really have a chance.<br>
             <br>
Then came Monday! A new doctor, a new day! This is when the option of a liver
transplant was presented and this time we left the office feeling overjoyed!
It was literally like seeing the light at the end of the tunnel!!<br>
             <br>
It has been almost 2 weeks since then, and things have moved rather quickly (which
we are very excited about) Jon and I go to the Medical University of S.C. in
Charleston on Monday, April 11th,where we will start the process of the liver
transplant. They have condensed the various tests and meetings that what would
normally take 4 days and squeezed it into one day.<br>
            <br>
They will be testing Jon and I as well to see who will be the best donor for
him. One of us will give just a portion of our liver to Ethan . He won't have
to go through anymore chemo once the tumor is removed.<br>
             <br>
You will see from the newest pictures the change in him from this last round
of chemo. He looks tired all the time because the muscles in his eyes are so
weak they just won't open all the way. His hair was almost all gone except for
this long straggly hair on top. So we gave him a little buzz cut on top to even
it out!! I told Emily that it feels like peach fuzz now, so the next day I heard
her in talking to him calling him "little peach head" (lovingly of course!)<br>
             <br>
We don't know exactly when Ethan will have the transplant, but we will try to
keep you all updated via this website.<br>
<br>
We are so grateful for all of your prayers and cards of encouragement. The Lord
continues to meet our needs in every way, spiritually,emotionally, physically
and financially for which we are so grateful. Jon and I still have such a peace
about everything and we know that it is only by God's grace and we give Him all
the glory and honor! <a href="#top"> &raquo;top of page</a>

          On February 8th,2005, our lives were completely changed! When we found
            out that Ethan had a tumor, Jon and I sat in silence not even able
            to speak to
            one another. But as the word began to spread, we began to feel a
            very noticeable peace come over us and we knew it was because people
            were praying!<br>
            <br> 
            It's a peace that passes all understanding! We could
            not have made it these past weeks without all the letters, calls,
            meals and especially prayers! We received such sweet notes and even
            money from people that we don't even know! What a blessing!<br>
            <br>
            Ethan
            is doing pretty good right now. We take it day by day because things
            change so fast! Molly, our oldest daughter came down with the chicken
            pox this week, and this was one of the only things that the Dr's
            said he shouldn't get because of his immune system. So she, as well
            as Emily & Evan are living at my parents until they are over that.
            It's suddenly very quiet at our house, but please pray for my parents
            as they now have the "lively" house!!<br>
            <br>
            Ethan should start a new round
            of chemo within the next week. He did remarkably well with the first
            cycle. He will have to have 3 more rounds which average out to about
            a month each, and then Lord willing, the tumor will be shrunk enough
            to remove it. It will then be followed by 2 more rounds of chemo.<br>
            <br>
            We
            have been able to have him at home with an IV that gives him all
            the nutrients he needs because he doesn't have much of an appetite
            due to the chemo and size of the tumor. We've spent about 20 days
            in the hospital over that past 5 weeks, so it has been really nice
            to be home for awhile!<br>
            <br>
            Please continue to pray! The Lord is so wonderful
            and we know that no matter what the outcome of this, He will receive
            all the glory and honor! We love each of you and again thank you
            so much for your love and prayers!<a href="#top"> &raquo;top of page</a>
